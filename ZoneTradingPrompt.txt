TI-5 Nested zone strategy

/*
Update the code
Once the pice comes to a zone, check if the zone is within another zone of the same type (supply or demand respectively). 
If yes , then 
    If demand zone - take long, stoploss below the zone at 30% of the zone height. TP at the nearest supply zone above but not closer than 1R
    If supply zone - take short, stoploss above the zone at 30% of the zone height. TP at the nearest demand zone below but not closer than 1R

Mark code with the user story TI-5

*/

Update the code
convert the indicator to a strategy
Once the pice arrives to a zone, check if the zone is within another zone of the same type (supply or demand respectively).
Arrives means: the candle crosses the zone boundary 
for demand the candle high is outside the zone and low is inside the Zone
for supply the candle low is outside the zone and the high is inside the zone

If yes , then 
    If demand zone - take long, stoploss below the zone at 30% of the zone height. TP at 2R
    If supply zone - take short, stoploss above the zone at 30% of the zone height. TP at 2R

Dont make any labels, generate a buy or sell order. 
Also generate alert on entry with the text: "Price entered a nested supply/demand zone"

    TP at 2R
  
If there is an uptrend 
and the price revisits a demand zone, meaning a red candle has (low is below  the zone and close above or within the zone) OR (close within the zone)
then 
    enter long,
    SL below the zone at 30% of the zone height
    TP at 2R
